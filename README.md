## Introduction to Wireframing  

### :pencil2: What is Wireframing?  
A **wireframe** is a low-fidelity, simplified outline of a webpage or app. It focuses on:  
- **Layout structure**  
- **Content placement**  
- **User flow**  
- **Functionality**  

### :star: Why is Wireframing Important?  

| Benefit | Description |  
|---------|------------|  
| **Early Visualization** | Helps stakeholders understand the projectâ€™s structure before design begins. |  
| **User-Centric Design** | Ensures intuitive navigation and usability before adding visual elements. |  
| **Cost & Time Efficiency** | Identifies flaws early, reducing expensive changes later in development. |  
| **Better Collaboration** | Serves as a reference for designers, developers, and clients. |

## :triangular_ruler: Key Elements of Wireframing  

### 1. Layout Structure  
Defines the spatial organization of components (headers, footers, columns).  
**Example**: A 3-column layout for an e-commerce site (navigation | products | cart).  

### 2. Navigation  
Shows how users move through the interface (menus, buttons, links).  
**Example**: A hamburger menu icon in mobile wireframes indicates hidden navigation.  

### 3. Content Placement  
Arranges text, images, and media hierarchically.  
**Example**: Hero section at the top of a homepage wireframe highlights key messaging.  

### 4. Functionality  
Outlines interactive elements (forms, search bars, CTAs).  
**Example**: A wireframe for a login page includes placeholder fields for email/password.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Tools for Wireframing

- **Figma**  
- **Adobe XD**  
- **Balsamiq**  
- **Sketch**  
- **Pen & Paper** (Quick sketches!)  

## :art: Types of Wireframes

### 1. Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- **What**: Basic sketches (often hand-drawn or digital placeholders) showing layout and structure.
- **Features**:  
  - No colors/images  
  - Simple shapes (e.g., squares for buttons, lines for text)  
  - Minimal detail  
- **When to Use**: Early design phases, brainstorming, or quick stakeholder feedback.

### 2. High-Fidelity Wireframes
- **What**: Detailed, pixel-specific mockups closer to the final design.
- **Features**:  
  - Actual content (text, icons)  
  - Grids/spacing accuracy  
  - Basic interactivity (e.g., clickable buttons)  
- **When to Use**: Late-stage prototyping, developer handoffs, or user testing.
